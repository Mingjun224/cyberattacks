            <div class="article_3 headline">Prosecutors believe the woman died from delayed treatment after hackers attacked a hospital's computers. It could be the first fatality 
                from a ransomware attack.</div>
            <br>
                <div class="article_3 body one">BERLIN — The first known death from a cyberattack was reported Thursday after cybercriminals hit a hospital in Düsseldorf, Germany, 
                    with so-called ransomware, in which hackers encrypt data and hold it hostage until the victim pays a ransom.

                    <br>
                <div class="article_3 body two">The ransomware invaded  30 servers at University Hospital Düsseldorf last week, crashing systems and forcing the hospital to turn away emergency patients. As a 
                    result, German authorities said, a woman in a life-threatening condition was sent to a hospital 20 miles away in Wuppertal and died from treatment delays.

                    <br>
                <div class="article_3 body three">The attack is the first reported death from a cyberattack. Hospitals have been a frequent target for cybercriminals, particularly ransomware attacks, because the 
                    need to access health records and computer systems creates urgency that increases the likelihood that victims will pay their extortionists.</div>
