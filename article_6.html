        <br>
            <div class="article_6 headline">American intelligence officials believe the malware could give China the power to disrupt or slow American deployments or resupply 
                operations, including during a Chinese move against Taiwan.</div>
            <br>
                <div class="article_6 body one">The Biden administration is hunting for malicious computer code it believes China has hidden deep inside the networks controlling power 
                    grids, communications systems and water supplies that feed military bases in the United States and around the world, according to American military, intelligence 
                    and national security officials.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                <div class="article_6 body two">The discovery of the malware has raised fears that Chinese hackers, probably working for the People's Liberation Army, have inserted code designed to disrupt U.S. 
                    military operations in the event of a conflict, including if Beijing moves against Taiwan in coming years.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                <div class="article_6 body three">The malware, one congressional official said, was essentially “a ticking time bomb” that could give China the power to interrupt or slow American military 
                    deployments or resupply operations by cutting off power, water and communications to U.S. military bases. But its impact could be far broader, because that same 
                    infrastructure often supplies the houses and businesses of ordinary Americans, according to U.S. officials.</div>
