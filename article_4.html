        <br>
            <div class="article_4 headline">The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, set off alarms because Guam would be a centerpiece of 
                any U.S. military response to a move against Taiwan.</div>
            <br>
                <div class="article_4 body one">Around the time that the F.B.I. was examining the equipment recovered from the Chinese spy balloon shot down off the South Carolina coast in
                    February, American intelligence agencies and Microsoft detected what they feared was a more worrisome intruder: mysterious computer code appearing in 
                    telecommunications systems in Guam and elsewhere in the United States.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                <div class="article_4 body two">The code, which Microsoft said was installed by a Chinese government hacking group, raised alarms because Guam, with its Pacific ports and vast American air base, 
                    would be a centerpiece of any American military response to an invasion or blockade of Taiwan. The operation was conducted with great stealth, sometimes flowing 
                    through home routers and other common internet-connected consumer devices, to make the intrusion harder to track.

                    <br>
                <div class="article_4 body three">The code is called a “web shell,” in this case a malicious script that enables remote access to a server. Home routers are particularly vulnerable, especially 
                    older models that have not had updated software and protections.</div>
