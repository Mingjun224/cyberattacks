            <div class="article_9 headline">Albania has been the target of repeated digital assaults believed to be linked to its sheltering of an Iranian dissident group on its

                <div class="article_9 body one">TIRANA, Albania — Customers at one of Albania's biggest banks got a shock shortly before Christmas when a curt text popped up on their 
                    cellphones: “Your account has been blocked. The balance of your account is zero. Thank you.”

                <div class="article_9 body two">The messages, which turned out to be fake, signaled the opening of a disruptive new front in what Albanian authorities, the United States and NATO have identified

                    capital, calling the assaults “absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means.”</div>
