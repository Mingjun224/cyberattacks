            <div class="article_10 headline">Since late November, medical professionals have been using pen and paper as experts work to get the facilities fully back online.</div>
            <br>
                <div class="article_10 body one">A Brooklyn hospital group that serves patients in some of New York's poorest neighborhoods has been battling the consequences of a 
                    cyberattack that forced some critical services offline.

                    <br>
                <div class="article_10 body two">The group, One Brooklyn Health, was hit by the attack in late November, officials confirmed. Now, even as cybersecurity experts work to get its three hospitals 
                    fully back online, doctors and nurses are forced to rely on methods most hospitals left behind in the 1990s: pen-and-paper patient care.

                    <br>
                <div class="article_10 body three">LaRay Brown, the chief executive officer of One Brooklyn Health — which includes Interfaith Medical Center, Brookdale Hospital Medical Center and Kingsbrook 
                    Jewish Medical Center — said that the hospitals were working with security experts to remediate the problems, which at one point shut down all-important hospital 
                    work stations through which health care providers access medical records, order prescriptions and fill in patient charts.</div>
