                <div class="article_7 body one">Ukraine's largest mobile operator said it had come under a powerful cyberattack on Tuesday morning that knocked out service to millions of 
                    people.

                    <br>
                <div class="article_7 body two">The company, Kyivstar, said that the attack also affected internet access and that it was “unclear” when service would be restored. The interruption poses real 
                    danger in a country where many rely on phone alerts to warn them of impending Russian bombardments.

                    <br>
                <div class="article_7 body three">“We are working to eliminate the consequences of this attack to restore communication as soon as possible,” the head of Kyivstar, Oleksandr Komarov, said in a 
                    video statement, adding that users' personal data had not been compromised.</div>
