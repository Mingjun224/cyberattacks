            <div class="article_2 headline">In testimony before Congress, Christopher A. Wray, the agency's director, said Beijing was preparing to sow chaos if disputes with the 
                United States flared into conflict.</div>
            <br>
                <div class="article_2 body one">Christopher A. Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, warned on Wednesday that China was ramping up an extensive hacking 
                    operation geared at taking down the United States' power grid, oil pipelines and water systems in the event of a conflict over Taiwan.

                <div class="article_2 body two">Mr. Wray, appearing before a House subcommittee on China, offered an alarming assessment of the Chinese Communist Party's efforts. Its intent is to sow confusion, 
                    sap the United States' will to fight and hamper the American military from deploying resources if the dispute over Taiwan, a major flashpoint between the two 
                    superpowers, escalates into a war, he added.

                <div class="article_2 body three">Before his testimony, F.B.I. and Justice Department officials revealed that last month, they had obtained a court order that authorized them to gain access to 
                    servers infiltrated by Volt Typhoon, a Beijing-directed hacking network that has targeted a range of critical infrastructure systems, often by infiltrating small 
                    businesses, contractors or local government networks.</div>
